<h2>My Heroes</h2>

<ul class="heroes">
  <li
    *ngFor="let hero of heroes"
    [class.selected]="hero === selectedHero"
    (click)="onSelect(hero)"

<app-hero-detail [hero]="selectedHero"></app-hero-detail>

<!-- 
  The *ngFor is Angular's repeater directive. 
  It repeats the host element for each element in a list. 
  In other words, it is similar to React element.map() in JSX. 
-->

<!-- 
  (click)="onSelect(hero)" is an example of Angular's event binding syntax.abs
  When the <li> is clicked, Angular executes the onSelect(hero) expression.
-->

<!-- 
    [(ngModel)] is Angular's two-way data binding syntax. 
-->

<!-- 
  <app-hero-detail> is a child of the HeroesComponent. 
  The [hero]="selectedHero" binds the two together - It is a one-way data binding
